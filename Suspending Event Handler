// This must be coded in App.cs

// Managing the Suspending event in C# is really simple. The first thing that you need is an event handler in  App.xaml.cs:
// In the first line of code, you get an object of the SuspendingDeferral class in order to notify the OS that your
// operations ended in the last line of code. Now that you have an event handler,you can attach your handler to the event: 

this.Suspending += OnSuspending; 

// app is an instance of your application that you can refer to by using the this keyword if you are working in  App.xaml.cs or 
// using the Current static property of the Application object: 

Application.Current.Suspending += OnSuspending; 

private async void OnSuspending(object sender, SuspendingEventArgs e)
{  
    var deferral = e.SuspendingOperation.GetDeferral();
    await SuspensionManager.SaveAsync();
    deferral.Complete(); 
}
