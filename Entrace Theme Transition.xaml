// Transition animations are used to render a control and are visible in the class diagram show in Figure 6-7.
// If you want to apply one of these transitions,
// you can simply add one them to the TransitionCollection of a control in the following way: 

 <Button>  
   <Button.Transitions>     
     <TransitionCollection>      
       <EntranceThemeTransition FromHorizontalOffset="-229"/> 
     </TransitionCollection> 
   </Button.Transitions> 
 </Button>
