// NFC provides a connection  between devices that are very close together (Within3-4 centimetres)
// The data is tranferred at a rate of 106,212 or 424 Kbit/second
// NFC operates at slower speeds than bluetooth(BT v2.1 is uo to 2.1Mbit/s) but consumes less power
// and doesnt require pairing
// It is assumed that this data tranfer is intentional so there is not normally any authentication as sych
// The user has positioned their device close to the other device
// The phone can connect to an unpowered NFC chip/tag
// Tags currently support between 96 and 4096 bytes of memory
